# Getting started

There are three ways to get started with darkflow.

   1) Just build the Cython extensions in place.

            python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

   2) Let pip install darkflow in dev mode (globally accessible but changes to the code immediately take effect)

            pip install -e .

   3) Install with pip globally

             pip install .
